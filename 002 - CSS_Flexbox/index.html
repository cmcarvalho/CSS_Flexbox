        Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
        The CSS Flexible Box Module Level 1, or flexbox for short, makes the once-difficult
task of laying out your page, widget, application, or gallery almost
simple. With flexbox, layout is so simple you won’t need a CSS framework.
Widgets, carousels, responsive features — whatever your designer dreams up —
will be a cinch to code. And, while flexbox layout libraries have already popped
up, instead of adding bloat to your markup, read this article, and learn how, with a
few lines of CSS, you can create almost any responsive feature your site
requires.

    <h1>
        Example
    </h1>

    <div>
        <h3>01 - Phalaenopsis Orchids (Phalaenopsis spp.)</h3>
        <img class="small-image" src="img/Orchid_01.jpg">
        <p>Commonly known as moth orchids, the species in the Phalaenopsis genus are ideal orchids for beginners, since they tolerate clumsy repotting efforts, and bloom on and off throughout the year. These orchids prefer diffused lighting conditions but are otherwise very easy to grow. There are about 75 recognized species within the genus and many dozens of readily available cultivars.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>02 - Brassavola Orchids (Brassavola spp.)</h3>
        <img class="small-image" src="img/Orchid_02.jpg">
        <p>Brassavola orchids have white or greenish flowers with narrow petals, and are exceptionally fragrant, especially in the evening when the perfume is released. The white color is indicative of many flowers that depend on moths for pollination. There are at least 20 species within the Brassavola genus, of which B. nodosa is one of the easiest to grow, especially for beginners.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>03 - Catasetum Orchid (Catasetum spp.)</h3>
        <img class="small-image" src="img/Orchid_03.jpg">
        <p>The large number of species within the Catasetum genus are known for their unusual waxy flowers. If your Catasetum orchid leaves begin to yellow and drop off, do not despair; this deciduous orchid loses its leaves naturally during winter dormancy. There is much variation in appearance between Catasetum species, but one feature they all have in common is the trait of producing male or female flowers, which bear little resemblance to each other. The male flowers have an anatomical trigger that forcefully ejects pollen onto visiting bees.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>04 - Cattleya Orchid (Cattleya spp.)</h3>
        <img class="small-image" src="img/Orchid_04.jpg">
        <p>Cattleya orchids have been widely hybridized, leading to a large variety of colors and forms. Many Cattleya orchids have appealing freckles, streaks, or other bicolor features. Some varieties are quite fragrant, and they are the most popular corsage orchid.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>05 - Cycnoches Orchid (Cycnoches spp.)</h3>
        <img class="small-image" src="img/Orchid_05.jpg">
        <p>This relative of the Cattleya orchid is also known as the swan orchid, as the elegant inflorescence of male flowers resembles a swan’s neck. As many as 30 spicily scented flowers may grow on one long-lived stem. There are nearly 40 accepted species within the genus. These plants must be allowed a dry period after flowering is completed.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>06 - Cymbidium Orchid (Cymbidium spp.)</h3>
        <img class="small-image" src="img/Orchid_06.jpg">
        <p>Cymbidium orchids, commonly known as boat orchids, may have small flowers compared to some orchid varieties, but their multiple flower spikes ensure a satisfying display. Good choices for beginners include the lime green 'Chica', the yellow and red 'Showoff', or the bright pink 'Frae', which were all recipients of the American Orchid Society’s Highly Commended Certificate.</p>
